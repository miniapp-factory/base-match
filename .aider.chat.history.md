#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized, dark‑themed logo featuring a stylized base icon (a stylized “B” with a subtle blockchain pattern) in the center, surrounded by a ring of small, glowing cryptocurrency symbols (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.). The background is a deep charcoal gradient with subtle pixelated glitch effects, giving a futuristic, meme‑heavy vibe. The logo should convey a sense of playful yet powerful crypto matchmaking, with a slight neon glow around the central icon to emphasize the app’s energetic, meme‑heavy personality.
